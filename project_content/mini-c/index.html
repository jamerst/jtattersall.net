        <h2>Mini-C Compiler</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        In my final year, I chose the Compiler Design module as one of my optional modules. This module covered the
        entire process of implementing a compiler, from parsing and lexing to machine code generation and optimisation.
        The coursework for this module involved creating a compiler for a subset of the C language, <em>Mini-C</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The compiler was written in C++ using the <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM compiler framework</a>. Three main
        phases of the compiler were created:
      </p>

      <h3>Lexing and Parsing</h3>
      <p>
        The lexing and parsing phase takes the input source code and transform it into a tree representation called the
        Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This form is easier to manipulate and utilise in later stages than the raw text of
        the source code. This was achieved by implementing a recursive-descent predictive LL(2) parser, which allows the
        correct grammar
        production rule to be easily determined by looking ahead by at most 2 symbols.
      </p>

      <h3>Semantic Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        The semantic analysis phase takes the AST from the parser and analyses it to check for any semantic errors.
        Examples of such errors are referencing out-of-scope or undefined variables, parameter number or type
        mismatches, and variable/function redefinitions. This phase is designed to detect all these possible errors, and
        return a useful message if an error is found. This is implemented by traversing the AST in a separate pass once
        generated, which allows the analysis code to be easily separated from the rest of the compiler, improving
        readability.
      </p>

      <h3>Intermediate Representation Generation</h3>
      <p>
        The final phase I implemented was the generation of LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR). IR is usually a
        lower-level representation of the program, similar to assembly code. LLVM provides a full IR language, which the
        compiler I created generates by traversing the analysed AST and generating the corresponding IR instructions for
        each node of the tree. LLVM handles the creation of actual machine code, which would be very complex to perform
        manually, and would not be feasible in the timescale for the module.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was my first introduction to C++, which I found challenging, but also gained confidence with quickly. A
        significant amount of work was required to complete the compiler, so this improved my experience with C++
        significantly. It also improved my understanding of all programming languages by allowing me to understand how
        source code is transformed into machine code to be executed.
      </p>
