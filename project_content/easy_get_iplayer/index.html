        <p>easy_get_iplayer was my first real project, and as a result is a little rough around the edges. I created it because my parents wanted to save content from BBC iPlayer like you would with a VCR or other physical medium, but in an easily-accessible digital format. <a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer">get_iplayer</a> is perfect for this, however its main interface is command line based, which would not be suitable for my parents to use, and I found the web-based PVR to also be a little too tricky for them to use, so instead I created my own simpler GUI for get_iplayer.</p>

        <p>easy_get_iplayer is relatively simple underneath, it just takes the necessary options, such as the programme to be downloaded, the quality and destination, and sends this data to get_iplayer which performs all the processing. The main disadvantage of this is that it is difficult to get feedback on the download process, so a big problem with it is that often no error feedback can be given. Another issue is that the file size estimates given by get_iplayer are often very wrong in my experience, which causes further issues when displaying the download percentage.</p>

        <p>Source code and binaries are available on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/jamerst/easy_get_iplayer_2.0">here</a>, although it hasn't been updated in almost a year, and so is likely to no longer work or be useful.</p>
