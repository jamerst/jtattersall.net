        <p>Wirus was the coursework set for another module in my first year, CS126 Design of Information Structures. This project was centered around a data set of around 20,000 patients who were infected with different strains of a fictional virus, and tasks were set to be performed on this data set efficiently, such as sorting, searching, implementing Java interfaces such as Iterator, and using data structures to accomplish particular operations.</p>

        <p>This project allowed me to gain valuable experience in ways to efficiently deal with large data sets, something which is very important in almost any field of Computer Science.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the source code for this project is not publicly available due to plagiarism concerns.</p>
