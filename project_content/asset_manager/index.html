        <p>For my Computer Science A Level coursework, I created an asset management system. I chose to create a system that a local company could have used to more easily keep track of their company assets. It was created using Visual Basic and Windows Forms for the GUI, with Microsoft Access used for the database. The system had many features, including importing and exporting of stored data, access from multiple clients simultaneously, interactive mapping and comprehensive searching and filtering options. Another assessed component was a full detailed report on the system, which covered the planning, development and testing stages of completing the project.</p>

        <p>The system worked very well, with no known bugs or issues, but it was fairly limited due to the technologies used. For example, Microsoft Access is not a great database system, as it is not as scalable or portable as other alternatives such as MySQL, but I was only able to utilise software already installed on the college systems, so I didn't have much of a choice in what database management system I used. In hindsight, a web-based application would probably have been a much better solution, but again, I didn't have the software option for this, nor did I have any hardware available to host it.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the source code for this project is not publicly available due to plagiarism concerns.</p>

        <p>Some screenshots of the main interface of the system are shown below.</p>
