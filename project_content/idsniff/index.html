        <p>The coursework task for CS241 Operating Systems and Networks was to create a system which would
          examine all packets flowing through a system to check for suspicious activity. This was done using
          the <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/">libpcap</a> library for intercepting the packets and POSIX
          threads for multithreading. The system had a couple of extra features beyond the specification,
          including live output statistics, full logging and configurable thread count. A full report was also
          written detailing my choices when designing and implementing the system.</p>

        <p>This project improved my confidence and ability of programming in C massively, as it was relatively
          complex and non-trivial, especially compared to earlier work I had done in C. The final result was
          fully functional and received a mark of 97%, for which I also received the 2nd place prize for best
          coursework.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the source code for this project is not publicly available due to plagiarism concerns.

        <p>A sample output of the application is shown below.</p>
