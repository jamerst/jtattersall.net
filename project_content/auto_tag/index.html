        <p>AutoTag is a utility for automatically tagging and renaming TV show episodes written in C#. AutoTag was inspired by an application I had been using for several years, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/autotvtagger/">Auto TV Tagger</a>, which performs the same function, but I always had a few issues with it, namely that it often failed to give useful error messages and couldn't handle invalid file name characters, meaning that I had to manually tag some files, which was annoying. I was unable to find any other alternatives which fulfilled my requirements of both renaming and tagging automatically, so I decided to create my own solution instead.</p>

        <p>Despite being my first C# project, development of AutoTag went smoothly and quickly, probably due to the fact that C# basically only differs from Visual Basic.NET in syntax. I did struggle to get some of the API working due to quite poor documentation, but because the source code for the wrapper was available, I could work it out quite easily from that. This project also taught me about the use of <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> instead of the BackgroundWorker method I had previously been using, which I actually found to be much easier to work with than the BackgroundWorker.</p>

        <p>AutoTag uses data from <a href="https://www.thetvdb.com/">thetvdb.com</a> using their free API, accessed through the <a href="https://github.com/HristoKolev/TvDbSharper">TvDbSharper</a> wrapper. File name parsing is provided by a part of <a href="https://github.com/pheiberg/SubtitleFetcher">SubtitleFetcher</a> and file tagging is provided by <a href="https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp">taglib-sharp</a>.</p>

        <p>Source code and binaries are available on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/jamerst/AutoTag">here</a>.</p>
