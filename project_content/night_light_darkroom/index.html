        <p>When I recently got a new phone, the Pixel 3a, I found that the screen was quite intense to use late
          at night, unlike my previous phone. To help alleviate this, I created a simple Android app to
          emulate the "Darkroom" mode of <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a>, which shows just the
          red channel of all colours.</p>

        <p>The app adds a quick-settings tile to toggle this behaviour, with a simple settings app, which works
          by setting the system Night Light feature to a colour temperature of 0K. This isn't usually
          supported by default, in fact the lowest colour temperature supported by default on my Pixel 3a was
          &asymp;2600K, which was personally far too high and reduced the effectiveness of the blue light
          filter significantly. To solve this, I created a <a
            href="https://github.com/jamerst/magisk-intense-night-light">module</a> for the root solution <a
            href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">Magisk</a> which overrides the minimum temperature
          option set by the ROM creator.</p>

        <p>This was the first Android app I wrote from scratch, so it further broadened my knowledge of
          developing for Android that I had already gained from working on open source projects such as <a
            href="https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/VinylMusicPlayer">Vinyl Music Player</a>. It also taught me
          many things about the internal workings of Android when creating the Magisk module, which I found
          particularly interesting.</p>

        <p>Both the <a href="https://github.com/jamerst/NightLightDarkroom">Darkroom app</a> and <a
            href="https://github.com/jamerst/magisk-intense-night-light">Magisk module</a> are open-source
          and available for download on GitHub.</p>
