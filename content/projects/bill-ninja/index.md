For one of my optional modules in my first year at the University of Warwick, I chose to take a web
development module, and as part of the assessment for this module, a task was set to create a bill
splitting application intended for use by students living in shared housing. The task included 7
mandatory features, which contained the core features necessary for the system to be usable and
useful, which accounted for 90% of the marks available, with a further 10% allocated for extra
features beyond the specification. I implemented several extra features, including more customisable
splitting (e.g. different amounts per person), a graphical representation of spending, full payment
history and email notifications. Development of the system went relatively smoothly, with a few
hitches encountered due to my lack of experience in the area at the start of development,
particularly with some of the more complex DOM manipulation required, but these were all
successfully overcome to produce the final solution.

The system was implemented using PHP and SQLite for the backend systems, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript
and jQuery for the frontend. The frontend made extensive use of technologies such as AJAX to improve
the user experience, and the system was designed to be as secure as possible using the resources
available (HTTPS was not available due to the use of a shared server, and the software stack not
under my control, with a severely outdated PHP version being in use). I feel I managed to create a
very good solution which went above and beyond the specification to provide a very usable
application, which with a few small modifications could easily be a commercial product. My final
mark for the coursework was 97%.

Unfortunately the source code for this project is not publicly available due to plagiarism concerns.

Screenshots of the finished system are shown below.
