I am a University of Warwick Computer Science graduate, with a keen interest in developing a variety of
different applications, particularly web applications. I enjoy using technology in general, and I pursue
this in my spare time through personal projects and hobbies, including technical theatre with amateur drama
groups and the university [technical theatre society](http://warwicktechcrew.co.uk/). I perform a
wide variety of behind-the-scenes roles, including rigging, electrical, and stage/technical management for the
many shows produced each year.

I have experience in a variety of languages and technologies. I enjoy learning new technologies and I am usually
able to become proficient in almost any language or framework quickly. I particularly enjoy working with modern
web frameworks such as ASP.NET Core and React.js in Linux environments using containers.
