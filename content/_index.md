I am a University of Warwick Computer Science alumni, with a keen interest in developing a variety of
different applications, particularly web applications. I enjoy using technology in general, and I pursue
this in my spare time through personal projects and hobbies.

I have experience in a variety of languages and technologies. I enjoy learning new technologies and I am usually
able to become proficient in almost any language or framework quickly. I particularly enjoy working with modern
web frameworks such as ASP.NET Core and React in Linux environments using containers.
